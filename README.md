Disasters generally arise with little or no warning, causing or threatening death or serious disruption to people. When disasters (like flood, earthquake or tsunamis) hit populated areas, members of the affected communities(especially kids) often gets separated from their family and it may lead to a situation where they could never meet.

We aim to develop a smartphone application that will focus mainly to connect missing children and aged people with their family  .

The application will include the following features:

1) It will provide general instructions and precautions to be followed in times of disasters.

2) It will let people share and receive information of lost and found children (also people of any age group )with everyone who are using    this application.

3) It will allow users to share their location and contact with other users by messaging or calling. 

4) The app matches the data and connects according to the information provided by two(one who posted missing person information and other    who posted found person information) users.

Detail description:

The app will have two interfaces; one will contain instructions to be followed during disasters . The other will implement lost and found part. With the internet, a user can access all the information of lost and found people uploaded on the application. On sharing his/ her location and contact number (location sharing will be featured by connecting application with google maps) the user can upload information as well.
If a user shares its location the data that user can access will be in the order of distance of uploader from the user, else it will be arranged randomly. A user can request any other user (who posted found  person)to connect with him/her. If the request is accepted they can call or message each other through this application. 
The application will compare each lost data with all found data. On finding more than a particular amount of similarity, both the users will be notified about each other.
All the above process can be implemented without internet using ad-hoc-enabled devices(data send without internet reaches specific number of people say 8 who are located near and from each of those 8 people ,data reaches to next 8 people and so on .In this way,data will reach a large population ).In this case, information sharing will be limited to a zone.
